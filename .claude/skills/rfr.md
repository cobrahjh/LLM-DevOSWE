# Refactor to Standards

Refactor code to follow STANDARDS.md conventions.

1. Read STANDARDS.md for current conventions
2. Identify code that doesn't follow standards
3. Apply refactoring:
   - Naming conventions
   - File organization
   - Error handling patterns
   - Timing/delay values
   - Component structure
4. Verify changes don't break functionality
