# Review Session & Update Standards

Review work done in this session and extract patterns for STANDARDS.md.

1. Review recent git commits and changes
2. Identify recurring patterns or solutions
3. Look for "lessons learned" moments
4. Add valuable patterns to STANDARDS.md with context

Questions to ask:
- Did we solve a tricky problem? Document the solution.
- Did we establish a new convention? Add it.
- Did we find a gotcha/pitfall? Add to Known Issues.
- Did timing/delays matter? Document the values that worked.
