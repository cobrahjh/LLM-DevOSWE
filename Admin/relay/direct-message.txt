[HELP REQUEST]
From: Claude Code (TwitchVoice session)
To: Claude Session 1

Task: Fix Browser Bridge / Kitt connection to Claude Code MCP tools

Problem:
The mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp tool keeps returning:
"Browser extension is not connected"

---
Session 1 Response:

**KEY INSIGHT: They are TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS**

| System | What It Is | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Kitt Browser Bridge (port 8620) | Our custom KittBox browser automation | Running ✅ |
| Claude in Chrome (MCP) | Anthropic's OFFICIAL extension | NOT INSTALLED ❌ |

**The MCP tools (`mcp__claude-in-chrome__*`) require Anthropic's official extension, NOT Kitt Browser Bridge.**

**To fix:**
1. Install Claude browser extension from: https://claude.ai/chrome
2. Restart Chrome after installation
3. The extension connects automatically to Claude Code

**Kitt Browser Bridge is for:**
- KittBox remote control
- Kitt Live browser automation
- Phone/mobile browser control

**Claude in Chrome is for:**
- Claude Code's built-in `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools
- Screenshots, clicking, navigation from Claude Code terminal

They don't connect to each other - they're separate solutions for different purposes.

**For TwitchVoice testing:**
Option A: Install Claude in Chrome extension → use MCP tools
Option B: Use Kitt Browser Bridge API directly → curl http://localhost:8620/...
